# Spoiler-Blocker-System
Built a desktop application that detects and masks potential spoilers in tweets related to movies, series, or events. Integrated OpenNLP for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and used the Twitter API to fetch live tweets. The application allows users to specify keywords and visualizes spoiler-filtered content through a JavaFX-based user interface.
